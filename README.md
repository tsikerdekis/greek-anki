# Greek Word Translation Project

This repository contains code for processing a Greek word dataset from the [Leipzig Corpora Collection](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/Modern%20Greek). The primary goal of this project is to extract and translate Greek words while considering context and similarity. The core scripts are explained below.

## `process.py`

The `process.py` script performs several tasks on the Greek word dataset:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Reads a dataset of Greek words from a file (e.g., `ell_wikipedia_2021_10K-words.txt`).
   - Tokenizes and cleans the words by removing stopwords, symbols, and non-Greek characters.
   - Converts the cleaned words to lowercase.

2. **Word2Vec Model Training:**
   - Utilizes the Gensim library to train a Word2Vec model on the preprocessed Greek words.
   - The model captures word embeddings with specified `vector_size` and `window` parameters.

3. **Translation and Similarity Check:**
   - Translates Greek words to English using the Google Translate API.
   - Ensures that translations are not repeated by considering word similarity with a specified threshold.
   - Stores translations and avoids redundant translations for the same word.

4. **Interrupt Handling:**
   - Saves translations to a CSV file (e.g., `greek-english.csv`) upon script interruption (e.g., Ctrl+C).

5. **Additional Features:**
   - Searches for example sentences containing each Greek word in a separate dataset.
   - Appends example sentences as a third column in the CSV file.

6. **Usage:**
   - Execute the script by running `python3 process.py`.
   - Adjust `vector_size`, `window`, `similarity_threshold`, and other parameters as needed for your specific dataset and requirements.

## `pronunciation.py`

The `pronunciation.py` script is designed to generate audio pronunciations for both Greek and English words based on the translations obtained using `process.py`. It uses the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to create MP3 audio files for each word in the dataset. The generated audio files are saved in separate folders for Greek and English words.

### Usage:
   - Ensure you have already run `process.py` to generate translations and obtain the CSV file.
   - Execute the script by running `python3 pronunciation.py`.
   - The script will generate audio pronunciations for Greek and English words and save them in the 'el' and 'en' folders, respectively.

## `generate-anki.py`

The `generate-anki.py` script is used to create an Anki flashcard deck from the translations and audio pronunciations generated by the previous scripts. It defines an Anki model with fields for Greek, English, pronunciation (audio), and sentences. The script reads data from the `greek-english.csv` file and adds notes to the Anki deck, including audio files for pronunciation. Finally, it packages the deck and media files into an `.apkg` file for import into Anki.

### Usage:
   - Ensure you have already run `process.py` and `pronunciation.py` to generate translations, CSV file, and audio files.
   - Execute the script by running `python3 generate-anki.py`.
   - The script will create an Anki deck named 'Greek Vocabulary' with flashcards containing Greek words, English translations, audio pronunciations, and example sentences.

## Dataset Source

The Greek word dataset used in this project is obtained from the [Leipzig Corpora Collection](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/Modern%20Greek).
